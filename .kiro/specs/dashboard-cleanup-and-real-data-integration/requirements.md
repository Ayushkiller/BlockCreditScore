# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on cleaning up the credit dashboard by removing duplicate functionality, eliminating unwanted sections, and ensuring all displayed data comes from real sources rather than mock/fake data. The goal is to create a streamlined, accurate dashboard that provides genuine credit analytics and insights based on actual blockchain data and ML models.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a single, unified credit dashboard without duplicate functionality, so that I can access all credit information in one coherent interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the credit dashboard THEN the system SHALL display only one unified dashboard interface
2. WHEN I navigate through the dashboard THEN the system SHALL NOT show duplicate sections or redundant functionality
3. IF there are multiple components providing similar functionality THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into a single, comprehensive component
4. WHEN I view the dashboard THEN the system SHALL present a clean, organized layout without conflicting or overlapping sections

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Privacy & Zero-Knowledge Proofs section removed from the dashboard, so that I can focus on the core credit analytics without unnecessary features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the credit dashboard THEN the system SHALL NOT display any Privacy & Zero-Knowledge Proofs section
2. WHEN I navigate through the dashboard THEN the system SHALL NOT show any ZK-proof related functionality
3. IF the Privacy & Zero-Knowledge Proofs component exists THEN the system SHALL remove it completely from the dashboard
4. WHEN the section is removed THEN the system SHALL maintain proper layout and spacing without gaps or broken UI elements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Social Credit & Gamification section to either be removed or display real data, so that I see accurate information rather than placeholder content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the Social Credit & Gamification section THEN the system SHALL display only real, actual data from blockchain sources
2. IF real social credit data is not available THEN the system SHALL remove the entire Social Credit & Gamification section
3. WHEN social credit data is displayed THEN the system SHALL NOT show any mock, fake, or placeholder data
4. WHEN the section displays data THEN the system SHALL source information from actual user interactions and community metrics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Credit Analytics section to display actual data from real ML models and blockchain sources, so that I can make informed decisions based on genuine credit insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the Credit Analytics section THEN the system SHALL display only real data from actual ML models
2. WHEN credit scores are shown THEN the system SHALL calculate them using real blockchain transaction data
3. WHEN analytics are displayed THEN the system SHALL NOT show any mock, fake, fallback, or placeholder data
4. IF real data is not available THEN the system SHALL show loading states or error messages rather than fake data
5. WHEN ML predictions are shown THEN the system SHALL use actual trained models with real input data
6. WHEN historical data is displayed THEN the system SHALL source it from actual blockchain events and transactions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the contracts layout to be separate from the main dashboard, so that I can access contract information independently without cluttering the analytics view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the main credit dashboard THEN the system SHALL NOT display contract layout information inline
2. WHEN I need to access contract information THEN the system SHALL provide it in a separate, dedicated interface
3. WHEN the contracts layout is separated THEN the system SHALL maintain all contract functionality in the dedicated section
4. WHEN I navigate between dashboard and contracts THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation paths between the sections

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all data sources to be real and verified, so that the system maintains data integrity and provides accurate credit assessments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component requests data THEN the system SHALL only return real data from verified sources
2. WHEN data is not available THEN the system SHALL NOT generate or display fake/mock data as fallback
3. WHEN ML models are used THEN the system SHALL ensure they are properly trained with real datasets
4. WHEN blockchain data is displayed THEN the system SHALL verify it comes from actual on-chain sources
5. IF a data source fails THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error states rather than fallback to mock data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the credit analysis dashboard to be populated with correct scores and ML model outputs, so that I can trust the accuracy of my credit assessment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view my credit score THEN the system SHALL calculate it using the correct ML model with my actual transaction data
2. WHEN credit analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL use real behavioral patterns and financial metrics
3. WHEN predictions are made THEN the system SHALL base them on actual ML model outputs trained on real data
4. WHEN risk assessments are shown THEN the system SHALL derive them from genuine analysis of my blockchain activity
5. WHEN comparative metrics are displayed THEN the system SHALL use real peer data and market benchmarks
