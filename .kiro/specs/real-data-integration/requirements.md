# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The **Real Data Integration** feature transforms the current crypto credit scoring system from using placeholder/mock data to utilizing authentic blockchain data, real market APIs, and live DeFi protocol interactions. This feature eliminates all simulated data sources and replaces them with verifiable, real-time data from Ethereum mainnet and established market data providers.

The system will connect directly to live blockchain nodes, fetch actual transaction data, interact with real smart contracts, and use authentic market data APIs to provide genuine credit scoring based on real user behavior and market conditions.

6. IF external APIs are down THEN the system SHALL use cached real data with clear staleness timestamps and reduced confidence indicators

### Requirement 4: Real Transaction History Analysis

**User Story:** As a user, I want my credit score to be based on my actual transaction history instead of generated data, so that my score accurately reflects my real DeFi behavior.
