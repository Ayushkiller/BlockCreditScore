# Requirements Document

## Introduction

**CryptoVault Nexus** is the world's first Autonomous Credit Intelligence Ecosystem that doesn't just score creditworthiness—it creates a living, breathing financial reputation that evolves, learns, and predicts across the entire Web3 multiverse. This isn't a credit scoring system; it's a **Financial DNA Sequencer** that maps the complete behavioral genome of every DeFi participant.

Our platform introduces **Quantum Credit Theory**—a revolutionary approach where credit scores exist in superposition states, dynamically collapsing into specific values based on context, market conditions, and interaction patterns. We're building the **Neural Network of Trust** that connects every wallet, every transaction, and every financial decision into a unified intelligence that can predict market movements, identify emerging risks, and automatically optimize the entire DeFi ecosystem.

The system operates as a **Decentralized Autonomous Credit Organization (DACO)** with self-governing protocols that evolve through community consensus, AI-driven optimization, and real-time market feedback. This creates an ever-improving credit intelligence that becomes more accurate and valuable with every interaction.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Dimensional Credit Scoring System

**User Story:** As a DeFi user, I want my creditworthiness to be evaluated across multiple dimensions rather than a single score, so that I can demonstrate my reliability in different aspects of crypto finance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's on-chain data is analyzed THEN the system SHALL generate five distinct credit dimensions: DeFi Reliability Score, Trading Consistency Score, Staking Commitment Score, Governance Participation Score, and Liquidity Provider Score
2. WHEN calculating each dimension THEN the system SHALL use weighted algorithms specific to that financial behavior category
3. WHEN displaying scores THEN the system SHALL present each dimension with clear explanations and improvement recommendations
4. IF a user has insufficient data for a dimension THEN the system SHALL mark it as "Insufficient Data" rather than assigning a default score

### Requirement 2: Ethereum Behavior Aggregation

**User Story:** As an Ethereum DeFi participant, I want my credit assessment to include my comprehensive behavior on Ethereum mainnet, so that my full DeFi profile is accurately represented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing user behavior THEN the system SHALL aggregate data from Ethereum mainnet only
2. WHEN processing transaction data THEN the system SHALL normalize transaction values to USD equivalents using Chainlink price feeds
3. WHEN a user connects multiple wallets THEN the system SHALL allow linking Ethereum wallets to create a unified credit profile
4. IF wallet data conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL apply conflict resolution algorithms prioritizing more recent and higher-volume activities

### Requirement 3: Predictive Risk Analytics

**User Story:** As a lender in the DeFi space, I want to understand not just current creditworthiness but predicted future risk, so that I can make more informed lending decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sufficient historical data exists THEN the system SHALL generate 30-day, 90-day, and 180-day risk predictions
2. WHEN calculating predictions THEN the system SHALL use machine learning models trained on historical default patterns and market conditions
3. WHEN market volatility increases THEN the system SHALL adjust risk predictions to account for increased uncertainty
4. IF prediction confidence is below 70% THEN the system SHALL display confidence intervals and uncertainty warnings

### Requirement 4: Privacy-Preserving Verification

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want to prove my creditworthiness without revealing sensitive transaction details, so that I can maintain financial privacy while accessing credit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating credit proofs THEN the system SHALL use zero-knowledge proof protocols to verify scores without exposing underlying transaction data
2. WHEN a lender requests verification THEN the system SHALL provide cryptographic proofs that confirm score validity without revealing calculation details
3. WHEN users opt for privacy mode THEN the system SHALL allow selective disclosure of credit dimensions while keeping others private
4. IF privacy verification fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to standard verification with user consent

### Requirement 5: Dynamic NFT Credit Certificates

**User Story:** As a DeFi participant, I want my credit score to be represented as a dynamic NFT that updates in real-time, so that I can easily prove and showcase my evolving creditworthiness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's credit profile is established THEN the system SHALL mint a dynamic NFT certificate containing their credit intelligence data
2. WHEN on-chain behavior changes THEN the NFT SHALL automatically update its metadata and visual representation within 24 hours
3. WHEN displaying the NFT THEN it SHALL show current scores, historical trends, and achievement badges for exceptional behavior
4. IF the user's score improves significantly THEN the NFT SHALL unlock new visual tiers and special attributes

### Requirement 6: Real-Time Behavior Monitoring

**User Story:** As a user building my credit reputation, I want my score to update when I perform positive financial behaviors, so that I can see benefits from responsible actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring user wallets THEN the system SHALL detect new Ethereum transactions within 15 minutes of blockchain confirmation
2. WHEN positive behaviors are detected THEN the system SHALL update relevant credit dimensions within 4 hours
3. WHEN significant negative behaviors occur THEN the system SHALL flag the account and adjust scores within 24 hours
4. IF the monitoring system detects anomalous behavior THEN it SHALL log the event for manual review

### Requirement 7: Social Credit Layer Integration

**User Story:** As someone who participates in peer-to-peer lending, I want my lending and borrowing history with other users to contribute to my credit score, so that my community reputation is reflected in my creditworthiness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users engage in P2P lending THEN the system SHALL track lending success rates, repayment timeliness, and default rates
2. WHEN calculating social credit THEN the system SHALL weight peer reviews and community feedback from verified transactions
3. WHEN disputes arise THEN the system SHALL provide a decentralized arbitration mechanism for resolution
4. IF social credit data is insufficient THEN the system SHALL not penalize users but mark this dimension as developing

### Requirement 8: Advanced Analytics Dashboard

**User Story:** As a user wanting to improve my credit standing, I want detailed analytics about my financial behavior patterns, so that I can understand how to optimize my credit score.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive analytics including behavior trends, score evolution, and peer comparisons
2. WHEN showing recommendations THEN the system SHALL provide specific, actionable advice for improving each credit dimension
3. WHEN displaying historical data THEN the system SHALL offer multiple time ranges and visualization options
4. IF users want to export data THEN the system SHALL provide secure data export functionality with privacy controls

### Requirement 9: DeFi Protocol Integration

**User Story:** As a DeFi protocol operator, I want to integrate credit intelligence into my lending platform, so that I can make better risk assessments and offer competitive rates to reliable users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN protocols request integration THEN the system SHALL provide standardized APIs for credit score retrieval and verification
2. WHEN processing API requests THEN the system SHALL return scores within 2 seconds with 99.9% uptime
3. WHEN protocols need custom scoring THEN the system SHALL allow weighted scoring based on protocol-specific risk preferences
4. IF API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement fair queuing and provide clear error messages

### Requirement 10: Gamification and Incentive System

**User Story:** As a user new to DeFi, I want to be motivated to build good credit habits through rewards and achievements, so that I can learn responsible financial behavior while improving my score.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users achieve credit milestones THEN the system SHALL award achievement badges and unlock new features
2. WHEN consistent positive behavior is maintained THEN the system SHALL provide bonus multipliers for score improvements
3. WHEN users refer others who build good credit THEN the system SHALL reward both parties with reputation boosts
4. IF users complete educational modules THEN the system SHALL provide temporary score boosts to encourage learning
