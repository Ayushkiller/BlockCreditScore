# Requirements Document

## Introduction

**CryptoVault Nexus** is the world's first Autonomous Credit Intelligence Ecosystem that doesn't just score creditworthiness—it creates a living, breathing financial reputation that evolves, learns, and predicts across the entire Web3 multiverse. This isn't a credit scoring system; it's a **Financial DNA Sequencer** that maps the complete behavioral genome of every DeFi participant.

Our platform introduces **Quantum Credit Theory**—a revolutionary approach where credit scores exist in superposition states, dynamically collapsing into specific values based on context, market conditions, and interaction patterns. We're building the **Neural Network of Trust** that connects every wallet, every transaction, and every financial decision into a unified intelligence that can predict market movements, identify emerging risks, and automatically optimize the entire DeFi ecosystem.

The system operates as a **Decentralized Autonomous Credit Organization (DACO)** with self-governing protocols that evolve through community consensus, AI-driven optimization, and real-time market feedback. This creates an ever-improving credit intelligence that becomes more accurate and valuable with every interaction.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Dimensional Credit Scoring System

**User Story:** As a DeFi user, I want my creditworthiness to be evaluated across multiple dimensions rather than a single score, so that I can demonstrate my reliability in different aspects of crypto finance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's on-chain data is analyzed THEN the system SHALL generate five distinct credit dimensions: DeFi Reliability Score, Trading Consistency Score, Staking Commitment Score, Governance Participation Score, and Liquidity Provider Score
2. WHEN calculating each dimension THEN the system SHALL use weighted algorithms specific to that financial behavior category
3. WHEN displaying scores THEN the system SHALL present each dimension with clear explanations and improvement recommendations
4. IF a user has insufficient data for a dimension THEN the system SHALL mark it as "Insufficient Data" rather than assigning a default score

### Requirement 2: Real Ethereum Data Integration

**User Story:** As an Ethereum DeFi participant, I want my credit assessment to use real on-chain data from actual Ethereum transactions, so that my credit score reflects genuine financial behavior rather than simulated data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing user behavior THEN the system SHALL connect to live Ethereum mainnet using real RPC endpoints (Alchemy, Infura, or Ankr)
2. WHEN processing transaction data THEN the system SHALL fetch actual transaction details using eth_getTransactionByHash and eth_getTransactionReceipt
3. WHEN normalizing values THEN the system SHALL use live Chainlink price feed contracts (ETH/USD: 0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419) for real-time USD conversion
4. WHEN monitoring wallets THEN the system SHALL use WebSocket connections to detect new transactions within 15 minutes of blockchain confirmation
5. WHEN identifying DeFi protocols THEN the system SHALL use actual contract addresses: Uniswap V3 Router (0xE592427A0AEce92De3Edee1F18E0157C05861564), Aave V3 Pool (0x87870Bca3F3fD6335C3F4ce8392D69350B4fA4E2), Compound Comptroller (0x3d9819210A31b4961b30EF54bE2aeD79B9c9Cd3B)
6. IF RPC endpoints fail THEN the system SHALL automatically failover to backup providers with exponential backoff retry logic

### Requirement 3: Real Market Data Predictive Analytics

**User Story:** As a lender in the DeFi space, I want risk predictions based on real market data and actual DeFi protocol performance, so that I can make informed lending decisions using current market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating risk predictions THEN the system SHALL use real market data from CoinGecko API or CoinMarketCap API for volatility indices
2. WHEN training ML models THEN the system SHALL use actual historical default data from Aave, Compound, and MakerDAO liquidation events
3. WHEN assessing market conditions THEN the system SHALL fetch real-time TVL data from DeFiPulse API or DefiLlama API
4. WHEN calculating volatility adjustments THEN the system SHALL use actual ETH price volatility from the last 30 days via price feed APIs
5. WHEN generating confidence intervals THEN the system SHALL use real statistical models based on actual prediction accuracy from backtesting
6. IF external APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL use cached data with clear staleness indicators and reduced confidence scores

### Requirement 4: Privacy-Preserving Verification

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want to prove my creditworthiness without revealing sensitive transaction details, so that I can maintain financial privacy while accessing credit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating credit proofs THEN the system SHALL use zero-knowledge proof protocols to verify scores without exposing underlying transaction data
2. WHEN a lender requests verification THEN the system SHALL provide cryptographic proofs that confirm score validity without revealing calculation details
3. WHEN users opt for privacy mode THEN the system SHALL allow selective disclosure of credit dimensions while keeping others private
4. IF privacy verification fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to standard verification with user consent

### Requirement 5: Dynamic NFT Credit Certificates

**User Story:** As a DeFi participant, I want my credit score to be represented as a dynamic NFT that updates in real-time, so that I can easily prove and showcase my evolving creditworthiness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's credit profile is established THEN the system SHALL mint a dynamic NFT certificate containing their credit intelligence data
2. WHEN on-chain behavior changes THEN the NFT SHALL automatically update its metadata and visual representation within 24 hours
3. WHEN displaying the NFT THEN it SHALL show current scores, historical trends, and achievement badges for exceptional behavior
4. IF the user's score improves significantly THEN the NFT SHALL unlock new visual tiers and special attributes

### Requirement 6: Real-Time Blockchain Monitoring

**User Story:** As a user building my credit reputation, I want my score to update based on real blockchain transactions I perform, so that I can see immediate benefits from responsible financial actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring user wallets THEN the system SHALL subscribe to real Ethereum WebSocket feeds (wss://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/API_KEY) for live transaction detection
2. WHEN new transactions are detected THEN the system SHALL fetch complete transaction details including gas usage, method calls, and event logs from actual blockchain data
3. WHEN analyzing DeFi interactions THEN the system SHALL decode real smart contract calls using actual ABI data for Uniswap, Aave, Compound, and MakerDAO
4. WHEN calculating behavior scores THEN the system SHALL use actual transaction amounts, frequency patterns, and protocol interaction history from blockchain data
5. WHEN detecting liquidations THEN the system SHALL monitor real liquidation events from lending protocols using event log filtering
6. IF blockchain connection is lost THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect and backfill missed transactions using block range queries

### Requirement 7: Social Credit Layer Integration

**User Story:** As someone who participates in peer-to-peer lending, I want my lending and borrowing history with other users to contribute to my credit score, so that my community reputation is reflected in my creditworthiness.
