# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses critical deployment and functionality issues that must be fixed within 5 hours for hackathon submission. The current system shows fake deployment data and doesn't actually deploy contracts, making it impossible to demonstrate the core credit scoring functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real Contract Deployment

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to see actual deployed smart contracts on testnet, so that I can verify the system works with real blockchain interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deploy button is clicked THEN the system SHALL actually deploy the SimpleCreditScore contract to the selected testnet
2. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL display the real contract address that can be verified on Etherscan
3. WHEN deployment fails THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages with actionable steps
4. WHEN viewing deployment history THEN the system SHALL show only real deployments with verifiable contract addresses

### Requirement 2: Working Credit Score Demo

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to interact with a working credit scoring system, so that I can evaluate the core functionality and innovation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a wallet is connected THEN the system SHALL create a real credit profile on the deployed contract
2. WHEN credit data is processed THEN the system SHALL update actual scores on the blockchain
3. WHEN viewing scores THEN the system SHALL display real data from the deployed contract
4. WHEN demonstrating the system THEN all core functions SHALL work end-to-end without fake data

### Requirement 3: Remove All Fake Data

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to see real data throughout the system, so that I can properly evaluate the actual functionality and innovation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any dashboard THEN the system SHALL display only real blockchain data, never mock or fake data
2. WHEN checking ML scores THEN the system SHALL show actual calculated scores from real data sources
3. WHEN viewing credit analytics THEN the system SHALL display real transaction analysis and scoring
4. WHEN accessing any API endpoint THEN the system SHALL return real data from blockchain or external sources
5. WHEN viewing price feeds THEN the system SHALL show actual market data, not simulated values

### Requirement 4: Fix Wallet Verification Issues

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to easily verify any wallet address, so that I can test the credit scoring for different addresses without barriers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system shows "Wallet Not Verified" THEN it SHALL provide a visible "Verify Wallet" button
2. WHEN clicking "Verify Wallet" THEN the system SHALL actually verify the wallet ownership
3. WHEN wanting to check any address THEN the system SHALL allow viewing credit details for any valid address
4. WHEN verification is not needed THEN the system SHALL allow direct address input for credit analysis

### Requirement 5: Working Credit Dashboard

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want functional credit dashboards, so that I can see the system analyzing real wallet behavior and generating meaningful scores.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the credit dashboard THEN the system SHALL show real credit scores calculated from actual blockchain data
2. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL display real transaction patterns and DeFi interactions
3. WHEN checking score history THEN the system SHALL show actual score changes over time
4. WHEN viewing different addresses THEN the system SHALL analyze real on-chain behavior for each wallet
