  - Replace each with real API calls or blockchain queries
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 2.3 Connect to REAL price feeds and market data
  - Integrate actual APIs: CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, DeFiPulse
  - Remove ALL simulated market data and volatility calculations
  - Implement real-time price monitoring with live market data
  - _Requirements: 3.5, 5.2_

- [x] 2.4 Make analytics and dashboards show REAL DATA ONLY
  - Query actual blockchain for transaction history (Etherscan API)
  - Connect to real DeFi protocols (Uniswap, Aave, Compound APIs)
  - Show actual score changes calculated from real wallet activity
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 3. Fix Wallet Verification and Address Input
  - Add missing "Verify Wallet" button where needed
  - Implement direct address input for credit analysis
  - Remove verification barriers for demo purposes
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 3.1 Add direct address input functionality
  - Create address input field in credit dashboard
  - Add address validation and formatting
  - Allow credit analysis for any valid Ethereum address
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4, 5.4_

- [x] 3.2 Fix missing wallet verification UI
  - Add "Verify Wallet" button where "Wallet Not Verified" message appears
  - Implement actual wallet verification process
  - Update UI states for verified/unverified wallets
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 3.3 Simplify wallet connection flow
  - Make wallet connection optional for viewing credit data
  - Allow demo mode with any address input
  - Remove unnecessary verification steps for hackathon demo
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 4. Connect Frontend to Real Deployed Contracts
  - Update contract addresses to use real deployed contracts
  - Test all contract interactions with actual blockchain
  - Verify credit profile creation and score updates work
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 4.1 Update contract integration
  - Replace hardcoded contract addresses with deployed addresses
  - Test contract connection and basic functions
  - Verify credit profile creation works on real contract
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 4.2 Test end-to-end credit scoring flow
  - Create credit profile for test address
  - Update scores using real transaction data
  - Verify scores are stored and retrieved from blockchain
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [-] 5. FINAL DEMO PREPARATION (EVERYTHING MUST WORK)
