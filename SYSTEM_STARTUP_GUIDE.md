# CryptoVault Credit Intelligence - System Startup Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start Options

### Option 1: Frontend Dashboard Only (Recommended for Demo)
```bash
start-dashboard.bat
```
- Starts only the frontend dashboard on http://localhost:3000
- Uses API data for realistic demonstration
- Perfect for UI/UX testing and demos

### Option 2: Backend API Only
```bash
start-backend.bat
```
- Starts only the API Gateway on http://localhost:3001
- Provides REST API endpoints for credit intelligence
- Generates realistic data based on wallet addresses

### Option 3: Full System (Frontend + Backend)
```bash
start-full-system.bat
```
- Starts both frontend and backend services
- Frontend connects to live backend API
- Complete system integration with realistic data
