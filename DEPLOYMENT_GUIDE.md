### 📊 Performance Metrics

| Operation | Gas Usage | Response Time | Status |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Create Profile | 460,000 | <1s | ✅ Optimized |
| Update Score | 112,000 | <1s | ✅ Optimized |
| Get Composite Score | 50,000 | <100ms | ✅ Optimized |
| Get Dimension Score | 30,000 | <100ms | ✅ Optimized |

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Smart Contract Architecture
```solidity
contract SimpleCreditScore is Ownable, ReentrancyGuard {
    // 5 Credit Dimensions
    enum CreditDimension { 
        DEFI_RELIABILITY, 
        TRADING_CONSISTENCY, 
        STAKING_COMMITMENT, 
        GOVERNANCE_PARTICIPATION, 
        LIQUIDITY_PROVIDER 
    }
    
    // Score tracking with confidence and trends
    struct ScoreDimensionData {
        uint256 score;           // 0-1000 scale
        uint256 confidence;      // 0-100 percentage
        uint256 dataPoints;      // Number of data points
        ScoreTrend trend;        // Score trend direction
        uint256 lastCalculated; // Timestamp
        bool hasInsufficientData; // Data sufficiency flag
    }
}
```

#### Key Features Implemented
1. **Multi-dimensional Scoring**: 5 distinct credit dimensions
2. **Confidence Intervals**: Data-driven confidence scoring
3. **Trend Analysis**: Automatic trend detection
4. **Gas Optimization**: Efficient storage and computation
5. **Authorization System**: Secure access controls
