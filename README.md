# Crypto Credit Score Protocol

A decentralized protocol to calculate a transparent and trustable crypto credit score based on on-chain user behavior.

## Overview

This project is a submission for the CryptoVate online hackathon. It aims to address the challenge of creating a reliable credit scoring system in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The protocol aggregates on-chain data, such as transaction history, staking habits, and DeFi interactions, to generate a credit score for each user.

## Project Structure

-   `/contracts`: Contains the Solidity smart contracts for the protocol.
-   `/scripts`: Includes deployment and interaction scripts.
-   `/test`: Houses the tests for the smart contracts.
-   `/frontend`: The user-facing dApp to interact with the protocol.
