# Social Credit Data Assessment

## Task 2.1: Assessment Results

### creditIntelligenceService Analysis

**Service Methods Available:**
- `getSocialCreditData(address: string)` - Makes API call to `/api/social-credit/${address}`
- `submitFeedback()` - Makes API call to `/api/social-credit/feedback`
- `getAchievements(address: string)` - Makes API call to `/api/achievements/${address}`

**Service Infrastructure:** ✅ Present and properly structured

### API Endpoint Analysis

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/social-credit/:address`
**Implementation:** Returns `mockCreditProfile.socialCredit` (mock data)
**Real Data Status:** ❌ No real blockchain data integration

### Frontend Component Analysis

**SocialCreditPanel.tsx:**
- Uses 100% hardcoded mock data
- No integration with creditIntelligenceService
- All stats, achievements, activities are static mock values
- No real blockchain data consumption

### Blockchain Data Assessment

**Social Interaction Metrics:** ❌ Not available
- No real P2P lending history from blockchain
- No real community feedback from on-chain sources
- No real dispute resolution data
- No real referral tracking from blockchain events

### Available Real Social Credit Data Sources

**Assessment Result:** ❌ **NO REAL SOCIAL CREDIT DATA AVAILABLE**

**Evidence:**
1. API gateway serves mock data (`mockCreditProfile.socialCredit`)
2. No blockchain data integration for social interactions
3. Frontend component uses hardcoded values
4. No real on-chain social credit metrics

## Conclusion

Based on requirements 3.1, 3.2, 3.4:
- Real social credit data is **NOT available**
- System currently serves only mock/fake data
- According to requirement 3.2: "IF real social credit data is not available THEN the system SHALL remove the entire Social Credit & Gamification section"

**Recommendation:** Remove SocialCreditPanel.tsx component entirely and clean up all related mock data functionality.
